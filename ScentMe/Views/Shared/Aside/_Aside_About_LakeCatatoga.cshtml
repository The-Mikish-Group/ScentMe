                    <strong>Lake Catatoga</strong> has a surface area of 66 acres, with a beautiful dam located on its northern end. 
                    The lake is situated midway between <span id="newTab" onclick="newTab('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis')">St. Lous, Missouri
                    </span> and <span id="newTab" onclick="newTab('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfield,_Illinois')">Springfield, Illinois</span>... 
                    nine miles south of the city of <span id="newTab" onclick="newTab('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlinville,_Illinois')">Carlinville</span>,
                    and eighteen miles west of <span id="newTab" onclick="newTab('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litchfield,_Illinois')">Litchfield</span>
                    in <span id="newTab" onclick="newTab('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macoupin_County,_Illinois')">Macoupin County</span>,
                    which is named after Macoupin Creek, near Carlinville and meanders southwest to the 
                    <span id="newTab" onclick="newTab('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois_River')">Illinois River</span>.

                    The region was previously inhabited by various Illinoisan Indians; Miami and Wea, as well as the tribes of the Illinois Confederation, 
                    including the Kaskaskia, Peoria, Tamaroa, Cahokia, and Mitchigamea. "Macoupin" is actually the 
                    <span id="newTab" onclick="newTab('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami-Illinois_language')">Miami-Illinois</span> term for the 
                    <span id="newTab" onclick="newTab('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelumbo_lutea')">"American Lotus"</span> (Nelumbo lutea). Unfortunately, 
                    none of the native Indians remain, although some descendants of the earliest European settlers claim partial ancestry. The first European arrivals 
                    were French explorers in the seventeenth century, travelling southward down the major rivers. However, the main European settlement came from the 
                    southwest, as people moved inland from the established transportation route of the Mississippi River.

                    Today, Lake Catatoga recaptures a bit of its Indian heritage with themed street names and even
                    <span id="newTab" onclick="newTab('http://lakecatatoga.com/pictures/totempole')">Totem Poles</span> located at the entrances. 
                    With a peaceful ambiance and convenient location, it's a highly desirable place to live and visit with a "no wake" policy creating safer conditions 
                    for swimming and boating. The Lake is annually stocked with a variety of fish including:

                    <b>private</b>, a Fishing License is required and Boat Registration is mandatory.
